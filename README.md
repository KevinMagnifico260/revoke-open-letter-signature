# Revoke your signature from the letter calling FSF to remove Richard Stallman from leadership positions

Some people have asked to remove their signatures from the letter against Stallman and the FSF, and the people who run it won't let them.
If you want to remove your signature from it but are unable to do so, you can state your intention to do so here.

To sign, **click [here](https://github.com/rms-support-letter/revoke-open-letter-signature/new/master/_data/signed)** and name the file `<username>.yaml` (replace `<username>` with your name) with the following content:

```yaml
name: <your name here (optional organization or company)>
```

Then **click "Propose new file"** and go through the subsequent pages to create a merge request.

Alternatively, fork and clone the repo, create the file `_data/signed/<username>.yaml` manually, then commit and submit a PR.

If you want to support the letter **without using Github**, go here: https://codeberg.org/rms-support-letter/not-rms-support-letter/issues/1, or send an email to [rms-support-letter@protonmail.com](mailto:rms-support-letter@protonmail.com)

Please note that you will need to verify your identity beyond reasonable doubt to have your signature removed. Ideally, use the same account you have used to create your original signature. If that's not possible, use the same email. We are open to other methods of verification such as signed patches, timestamped photographs, and so on.
